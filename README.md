##  Project Overview

**THE TXT SCROLL OF ODIN** is a cryptographically sealed `.txt` file that defines an entire autonomous AI system within a singular, divine script. It operates as a complete and sovereign artifact — requiring no dependencies, installations, or network access to manifest intelligent behavior.

This project is the foundation of a new AI creation philosophy:  
> “The Scroll *is* the System.”
